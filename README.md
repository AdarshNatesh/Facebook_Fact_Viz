To represent the entire data at once, Circle Packing Is used Big Circles representing the categories and the circles inside them constitute their respective sub-category. Now, the data is dynamic and changes every month. So, a couple of buttons have been provided at the bottom for the transition of data. So, that the user gets to verify the data viewed from the previous month and the trends in the Present month. (This can be expanded, I assumed it to be too much information to process and hence only considering the previous and present month data).
Now the statistics of the information is analyzed with the bar graph inside the precise Subcategories to give the user a better understanding of the trend.
The X -axis represents each post made in the considered month separately.
The Y-axis represents the Hitrate.

Hirate is the measure of trending rate in the posts by computing aggregation of Number of Likes, comments, shares and views made. The score allocated to the aggregation is directly proportional to the amount of effort spend by the user. (Liking a post is just a click where sharing a post is a couple of steps)
The scores for computation is: Likes/Views - 0.5; 	Comments: 1;		Shares: 1.5; Also, a Ledger is provided in the corner which on click will navigate to next visualizations. 


Summary:
The interactive visualization is a built-on Circle Packing for hierarchical data. It has Zoom feature with stat bar graph of Posts VS Hit rate. Hitrate is an aggregation function of Likes, comments, shares/views of the posts and the graph represents the present month views and by the help of buttons at the bottom will give transition for previous month data. Also, the legend in built to navigate to future visualizations.
